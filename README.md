**planckreset** is quite possibly the smallest CSS reset in the universe. *At only 79 bytes*, simply copy and paste the planckreset code snippet at beginning of your CSS.

The goal of this project is to provide a bare-essentials CSS reset that lays out the most minimal framework for basic webpages. For example, if you're making a basic static website that simply displays an image in the center using `display: flex`, you probably don't need a full CSS reset for every possible HTML element.

Sometimes you just need the basics:

- Set 100% width, and clear padding and margins on `<html>` and `<body>` 
- Set `box-sizing: border-box` on all elements

Sometimes you just need the smallest bit of help and that's where **planckreset** comes in.

## insert this code snippet at the start of your CSS:

`body,html{width:100%;margin:0;padding:0}*,:after,:before{box-sizing:border-box}`
